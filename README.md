# Split Keyboard cases 

[![N|Solid](https://cldup.com/dTxpPi9lDf.thumb.png)](https://nodesource.com/products/nsolid)

Modifications on some well known split keybord cases for my purposes

  - Top plates with Hybrid Cherry MX/Alps support
  - Top plates with Only Alps Support
  - Using a third plate to add tilt on the Let's Split and the Crkbd

# Ergodash
* Added clearance on the [top](images/ergodash_clearance_1.jpg) and [bottom/foot](images/ergodash_clearance_1.jpg) plates for a problematic screw.
