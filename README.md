# Split Keyboard cases 
[![N|Solid](https://cldup.com/dTxpPi9lDf.thumb.png)](https://nodesource.com/products/nsolid)

Modifications on some well known split keybord cases for my purposes
  - Top plates with Hybrid Cherry MX/Alps support
  - Top plates with Only Alps Support
  - Using a third plate to add tilt on the Let's Split and the Crkbd

## Ergodash
![](images/ergodash.jpg)
* Hybrid Cherry MX/Alps and Alps Only support top plates.
* Added clearance on the [top](images/ergodash_clearance_1.jpg) and [bottom/foot](images/ergodash_clearance_2.jpg) plates for a problematic screw.
* The top plate will work with the standard bottom/foot plates.

## Let's Split
